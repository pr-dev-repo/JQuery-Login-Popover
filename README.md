<h1> JQuery Validate Popover </h1>

<h3>Use this plugin to validate, along with jQuery validate() parameters and display error message in an Bootstrap popover.

The same is optimized to hide on click anywhere outside the popover area, plus fixes bug where you have to click twice to get the popover again.
</h3>

<h4>
Since it's a simple plugin, i will not provide Models or Controllers for this, as this is an MVC project in ASP.NET CORE. Also i am only providing JQuery Validate libs.
